			<h1 class="title is-size-2">ACCESS TO BLUE GALLERY COCOA WAREHOUSES</h1>
			<p>In view of the seeming confusion regarding the readiness or accessibility of one of our warehousing facilities, commonly referred to as “Blue Gallery Warehouse”, which is located on the Aflao road towards the Tema Motorway Roundabout, the management of Tarzan Enterprise Limited would like to issue the following clarification to its cherished stakeholders in the cocoa industry in Ghana.</p>

					<p>Despite the ongoing disruption of the normal traffic flow around Tema Motorway Roundabout and its connecting roads, due to the combined effect of the “Tema Intersection Road Expansion Project” and the “Tema-Akosombo Railway Project”, all the warehouse facilities of Tarzan Enterprise Ltd. remain unaffected in their operations.</p>
					<p>In fact, the company has been assured by the various contractors (Shimizu-Dai Nippon Joint Venture - SDJV, CTI Engineering International Co.) of their willingness to maintain alternative entry/exit points to our affected facilities, throughout the various phases of the ongoing construction work, in order to ensure a continued and uninterrupted access to cocoa-related logistics operations.</p>
					<p>Of particular concern is the Blue Gallery Warehouse, which is a high-quality facility that is earmarked for the storage of one of the country’s highest grades of export cocoa, referred to as “Japan Cocoa”. While the regular access point has been temporarily blocked for heavy articulators from Aflao road, an alternative entrance has been created by the contractors from the Akosombo road that is pliable by heavy articulators, as indicated in the map below.</p>

					<p> In addition to that, an access point from Aflao road is available for passenger vehicles and SUVs. Moreover, the contractors have also assured us of the restoration of normal access upon completion of their construction project.</p>
					<p>Therefore, we urge our cherished stakeholders to desist from spreading or communicating false claims regarding the readiness of our facilities and its access roads. Tarzan Enterprise Ltd. takes pride in its long history in supporting the Ghanaian economy and supporting the cocoa value chain with solid, high-quality logistics services since 1979. We assure you of our readiness and wish you all a very fruitful and successful cocoa season, in the interest of our industry and the nation.</p>
